According to your phone, it's 9:11am.

Jeff is now eleven minutes late. You are starting to regret agreeing to meet him
here. 

At that moment, he and a woman you do not recognize walked through the door. You
feel worse than when he wasn't here. Both he and the woman are dressed in formal
business attire; no one at the Skynet office would have worn any clothes even
remotely close to as formal as they looked. T-shirt and non-gym shorts would
serve as perfectly acceptable clothes for a summer day such as today.

They come here often.

-- Hello, I'm Claire, from Eve Elle Software.

She stuck out her hand. You hesitate before shaking it. She continues talking.

-- We are here in order to offer you a job.

-- I don't understand. I didn't apply there... I can't think of anyone works
   there.

Jeff smiles at you in a conceited 'I know more than you' kind of way. Claire

   a job. A full-time, real job. Not an internship. Of course, we know you are 
   pursuing a graduate degree, and will support you in whatever way we can while 
   you complete it.

-- I've helped you?

-- Of course. You have been finding the backdoors in the software. This helps us
   build more sophisticated backdoors. In fact, recently, you have convinced us
   that including a backdoor in software at all is a poor idea. It's insecure,
   allowing attackers such as yourself to break in.

   Jeff tells me that you will not likely be hired by Skynet when your intern-
   ship concludes. Is that a fair judgement?

You remain silent.

-- Consider our offer. If you accept,
