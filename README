Storyline:
- 09: Kelly accuses you of leaking secrets to Eve Elle Software, you decide to do some snooping and come across some binaries
- 10: From the previous snooping, you found Jeff's name in the filenames of a few encrypted documents, you decide to snoop
      around on his computer, and discover he's logged into a development server related to Eve Elle Software, with some
      binaries on it that you can use to discover how to exploit the production server.
- 11: From the production server, you find documents with your name, picture, address, and other private information. You
      do some more digging on the development server that Jeff is logged into, and find more binaries.
- 12: Jeff comes in, and almost catches you. It's late at night and you ask why he's in the office, he asks the same. You both
      leave, clearly suspicious of each other. You go home, and realize you need a more aggressive approach. You look at one
      piece of software made by Eve Elle Software. You want to see if you can exploit it to gain access, but in this one, there 
      isn't a backdoor. Buffer overflow.
- 13: You find information about a company overhaul in Eve Elle Software. You see plans to lay off more than half of their employees. 
      There are some email chains about various tasks related to that. One is called "Project Sniper," and it has your name. You don't
      even work for them, so you are confused. You find out more by exploiting more of their binaries.
- 17: It's now Monday, so you have to go back to work. You see Jeff, but avoid eye contact. Kelly is still suspicious of you, and hands
      you something to keep you busy. She has some excuse, but clearly the puzzle was designed to make you spend a lot of time on it.
- 18: Jeff pulls you aside, you don't really want to talk to him, but he tells you he knows what's up and to trust him. You reluctantly
      agree on the basis that nothing else can go wrong at this point. He informs you that he needs you to break just one more binary for
      him. You snap, you don't want to do it, you're already accused of leaking secrets and you tell him that you know that he leaked the
      secrets. At that moment, Kelly comes in with another busywork task.
- 19: Jeff pulls you aside again, telling you that he will explain everything, and to come with him to go to a restaurant for lunch. He
      will pay. There, a woman named Claire tells you that Eve Elle Software is impressed with your work helping them secure their system.
      You ask them what is going on. They say, you've figured out how to break into our system, allowing our engineers to fix all of the
      problems. Jeff reports back to us every day with info on your work. They have info that you are about to be fired from Skynet Software,
      and urge you to resign and take up a full time (non-internship) job with them. You accept. When you get there, you engage in the onboarding
      process, but the key was corrupted.
